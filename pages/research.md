## Topographic code
What is the role of functional maps in integrating and encoding visual information?

<!---Visual cortexes are organized in multiple functional maps and even small stimuli activate large and complex topographic representations.


For example, the position of an object in the visual field can be decoded from its representation in the retinotopic map in V1 cortex. At the same time, the local orientation of its different parts can be decoded from the response of --->
