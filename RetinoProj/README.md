# Retinotopy Model

## Primary visual cortex
Most of V1 cortex is buried within the calcarine sulcus (*Fig1*). However, in macaques the retinotopic area representing the central area of the visual field (~until 5dva of eccentricity)is exposed and can be optically imaged (*Fig2*).

 <b>Fig1 Retinotopic maps in V1 of different species.</b> <br>
 Each panel shows medial (left) and posterior (center) views of partially ‘inflated’ right hemispheres of the brains of the three species, based on MRI reconstructions of the middle layers of the cortex. The location of area V1 is indicated in red. On the right are two-dimensional models of the retinotopic organization of V1, fitted to high-resolution data. The grey region indicates the part of V1 that is buried within the calcarine sulcus, and the yellow region indicates the part that is exposed on the surface of the occipital lobe (white indicates regions that are exposed on the mesial surface of the brain). Corresponding landmarks are shown for macaque and marmoset monkey. Scale bars in all panels = 5 mm. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.11.003"> (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.11.003 </a>)

 <b>Fig2 Retinotopy in macaque brain.</b> This figure shows pretty well the configuration of the retinotopic map in macaque monkey, in particular with respect to the lunate sulcus and the calcarine sulcus. As you can see the maximum eccentricity in the exposed part of V1 is 5 degree of visual angle.<br>

## Superior culliculus
The retinotopic model we describe can be also used for the superior culliculus.
