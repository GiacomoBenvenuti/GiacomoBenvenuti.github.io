# Retinotopic Model

![retino3D](./figures/retino3D.jpg)
*Each panel shows medial (left) and posterior (center) views of partially ‘inflated’ right hemispheres of the brains of the three species, based on MRI reconstructions of the middle layers of the cortex (prepared with CARET [19]). The location of area V1 is indicated in red. On the right are two-dimensional models of the retinotopic organization of V1, fitted to high-resolution data as described elsewhere [13, 16]. The map of human V1 indicates the positions of imaginary lines that join the locations of neurons representing parts of the visual field located at different distances from the point of fixation (2.5°, 5° and so on), as well as regions representing the upper (+) and lower (–) parts of the visual field, and the representation of the horizontal meridian (red line). The grey region indicates the part of V1 that is buried within the calcarine sulcus, and the yellow region indicates the part that is exposed on the surface of the occipital lobe (white indicates regions that are exposed on the mesial surface of the brain). Corresponding landmarks are shown for macaque and marmoset monkey. Whereas in the human brain there is good correspondence between the representation of the horizontal meridian and the main fold of the calcarine sulcus (dashed line), this simple relationship is not present in marmoset and macaque. This occurs despite the striking similarity in retinotopic organization, across brains that differ over 100 times in mass. Scale bars in all panels = 5 mm.
